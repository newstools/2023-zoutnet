News - Date: 27 January 2023 Written by: Kaizer Nengovhela / Viewed: 932 Three contract workers from a private company were rescued and one died on Thursday (26th) after the four-metre-wide hole they were digging to fix a sewer line collapsed on them, trapping them inside the manhole. The company was hired by the Vhembe District Municipality to fix the blocked sewer pipe in the industrial area in Louis Trichardt. Residents have been forced for months to watch their step as a stinky sludge of toxic sewage seeped from this manhole. The incident occurred at around 09:30 that day. Local emergency services were summoned, and Polokwane’s EMS also arrived with their helicopter to help rescue the three workers who were still trapped inside the manhole. The operation took several hours, but by 15:00 the men were finally freed. One worker died on the scene, while two were rushed to Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital for treatment. A third worker sustained only mild injuries. The police confirmed the incident and said an inquest docket was opened.
