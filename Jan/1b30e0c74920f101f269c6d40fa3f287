News - Date: 28 January 2023 Written by: Maanda Bele / Viewed: 16904 The police have confirmed rumours that the wife of popular comedian, Livhuwani Madadzhe, popularly known as SABC Livhu, was found dead this morning at their home in Ha-Sidou. This is a day after Madadzhe appeared in the Thohoyandou magistrate’s court on charges of assault. The charges against him were apparently withdrawn by his wife. “The police are still at the scene, for now. We don't know the cause of death, but her husband called and told us that he found her dead,” said the spokesperson for the police in Makhado, Sergeant Tshifhiwa Radzilani. In August 2021 Lindelani “Mmea Muofhe” Nengovhela claimed that her husband physically abused her. She also alleged that he brought women to their marital home in her presence and emotionally abused her. The case was supposed to have been heard on Friday (27th), but did not proceed. Just after 13:00 on Friday (27 January), shortly after leaving court, Madadzhe posted pictures on his Facebook site of him and a seemingly elated Lindelani. He also posted pictures of bottles of liquor, presumably indicating that a celebration is waiting. The police did not state whether Madadzhe is a suspect in the case, but did confirm that he was questioned about the death.
